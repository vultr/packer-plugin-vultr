# Vultr

Type: `vultr`

The `vultr` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[Vultr](https://www.vultr.com). The builder takes a source image,
runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots
it into a reusable image. This reusable image can be then used as the
foundation of new servers that are launched within Vultr.

The builder does *not* manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

**NOTE**: Packer-Builder-Vultr [v2+](https://github.com/vultr/packer-builder-vultr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200-2020-11-23) uses [API V2](https://www.vultr.com/api/)


### Required:

-   `api_key` (string) - The Vultr API Key to access your account.

-   `region_id` (string) - The id of the region to launch the instance in. See [List Regions](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-regions).

-   `plan_id` (string) - The id of the plan you wish to use. See [List Plans](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#tag/plans).

**NOTE**: that  `os_id`, `app_id`, `snapshot_id`, or `iso_id` are not required and are optional. You **must** supply at least one for instance creation.
### Optional

-   `os_id` (int) - The id of the os to use. This will be the OS that will be used to launch a new instance and provision it. See [List Operating Systems](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-os).

-   `snapshot_description` (string) - Description of the snapshot.

-   `snapshot_id` (string) -   If you've selected the 'snapshot' operating system, this should be the ID of the snapshot. See [Snapshot](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-snapshots).

-   `iso_id` (string) - If you've selected the 'custom' operating system, this is the ID of a specific ISO to mount during the deployment. See [ISO](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-isos).

-   `iso_url` (string) - Upload a new ISO from this url that is publicly accessible. See [Create ISO](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/create-iso). This ISO will be deleted upon successful provisioning, or if the build is cancelled.

-   `app_id` (int) - If launching an application, this is the ID to launch. See [App](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-applications).

-   `image_id` (string) If launching a marketplace application. See [App](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-applications). Note marketplace applications are denoted by `type: marketplace` and you must use the `image_id` not the `id`.

-   `enable_ipv6` (bool) - IPv6 subnet will be assigned to the machine. Defaults to `false`

-   `enable_private_network` (bool) - Enables private networking support to the new server. Defaults to `false`

-   `script_id` (string) - If you've not selected a 'custom' (OS 159) operating system, this can be the `id` of a startup script to execute on boot. See [Startup Script](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-startup-scripts).

-   `ssh_key_ids` (array of string) - List of SSH keys to apply to this server on install. Separate keys with commas. See [SSH Key](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-ssh-keys).

-   `instance_label` (string) - This is a text label that will be shown in the control panel.

-   `userdata` (string) - Base64 encoded user-data.

-   `hostname` (string) - Hostname to assign to this server.

-   `tag` (string) - The tag to assign to this server.

-   `state_timeout` (string) - A duration to wait for the instance to boot, or a snapshot to be taken. Must be a string in [golang Duration-parsable format](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration), like "10m" or "30s". Defaults to `10m`

You may also adjust the [SSH communicator settings](https://www.packer.io/docs/communicators/ssh) to configure how Packer will log into Vultr Instances.
### Example Usage


```hcl
variable "vultr_api_key" {
  type    = string
  default = "${env("VULTR_API_KEY")}"
}

source "vultr" "ubuntu-20" {
  api_key              = "${var.vultr_api_key}"
  os_id                = "413"
  plan_id              = "vhf-1c-1gb"
  region_id            = "atl"
  snapshot_description = "testing"
  state_timeout        = "10m"
  ssh_username         = "root"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.vultr.ubuntu-20"]
}
```
