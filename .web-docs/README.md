Vultr.

packer {
  required_plugins {
    vultr = {
      version = ">= 2.5.0"

### Components

#### Builders

- [vultr](/packer/integrations/vultr/vultr/latest/components/builder/vultr) - The builder takes a source image, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots it into a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the foundation of new servers that are launched within Vultr.
